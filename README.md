# Image-Classification
This project classifies images of flags from five countries: Brazil, USA, India, Japan, and Egypt using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify flag images into their respective countries. The model is trained using a dataset of flag images and utilizes transfer learning for better accuracy.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of images of flags from the following countries:
- Brazil
- USA
- India
- Japan
- Egypt

The images are organized into separate directories for each country.
